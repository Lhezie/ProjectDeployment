      <section style="font-size: clamp(14px, 1.5vw, 16px)" id="about-me">
        <p>
          My journey into the world of technology began with a passion for
          creativity and problem-solving, which naturally led me to pursue a
          career as a front-end developer. Transitioning into tech has been an
          exhilarating experience, allowing me to combine my love for design
          with the technical skills needed to bring ideas to life. However, I’ve
          realized that my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web
          developer, where I can contribute to both the front-end and back-end
          aspects of a project. This ambition has driven me to join AltSchool
          Africa, where I am now committed to deepening my knowledge in back-end
          development. With a dedication to learning and a strong work ethic,
          I’m excited to take on this new challenge and move closer to achieving
          my full potential in the tech industry. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Beyond the lines of code, I
            find solace and expression in writing spoken word poetry. It's a
            creative outlet that allows me to explore the depths of language and
            emotion, much like how coding allows me to craft intricate solutions
            to complex problems. My love for learning, whether it’s mastering a
            new programming language or perfecting a verse in poetry, keeps me
            motivated and constantly evolving. I believe that the combination of
            these passions—technology and poetry—makes me a well-rounded
            individual, ready to tackle any challenge and create meaningful,
            impactful work in all areas of my life.
